ENC[1] CMD | DATA
ENC :
'1' (0x31) = 1-byte encoding ( normal packet )
'2' (0x32) = 2-bytes encoding ( wstring )

** multiple type encoding not supported, send multiple packet or special implementation

CMD :
1-byte encoding string (ex. READ RETR YOUT)
end with '|' char

DATA :
byteArray with encoding defined by ENC


--- Reading ---
1. Read 1 byte for ENC
2. Read until reach first '|' , treat them as 1-byte encoding string , for CMD
3. Read after first '|' , decode them with ENC , for DATA
