ENC[1] OPCODE | ID | DATA
ENC :
'1' (0x31) = 1-byte encoding ( normal packet )
'2' (0x32) = 2-bytes encoding ( wstring )

** multiple type encoding not supported, send multiple packet or special implementation

OPCODE :
1-byte encoding string (ex. READ RETR YOUT)
end with '|' char

ID :
Numbers 
Special packet identifier that will return back with the response
"1" - "999999999" = Normal ID
"0" = Server's packet ID

DATA :
byteArray with encoding defined by ENC


--- Reading ---
1. Read 1 byte for ENC
2. Read until reach first '|' , treat them as 1-byte encoding string , for OPCODE
3. Read after first '|' until second '|' , treat them as 1-byte string , for ID
4. Read after second '|' , decode them with ENC , for DATA
